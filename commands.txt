1.To generate the ssh key for GitHub:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "james@google.com"
## it will prompt for ssh key name and pass phrase, you can either provide them or leave blank. 
Once public and private key is generated, copy the content of public key and store them in your github(Profile-->Settings-->SSH key & GPG Key).

2. Add the private key from your laptop/Desktop:
ssh-add ~./<name of private ssh key>
## you will see message saying "identifed.."

3. To check the connectivity whether ssh key is working or not
ssh -vT git@github.com
## you will see message saying "Hi! XYZ .."

4. To initialse a local repository as git repo:
git init
## You will see message something like "repository initialsed as git repo"

5.To Configure user email and username:
git config --global user.email "James@google.com"
git config --global user.name "James"

## To verify user.email and user.name:
git config --global user.email / user.name

6. To check the status of your repo for changed/unchanged files:
git status

7. To check the remote url of your repo:
git remote -v

8. To add a new created/modified file to staging Area:
git add <file_name>

9. To commit your changes to local repo:
git commit -m "message"

10. To push your changes to remote repo:
git push

11. To pull the changes from remote repo to your local repo:
git pull 

12. To Undo a change in a file from working directory:
git checkout -- <file name> 

13. To Undo a change from staging area:
git reset -- <file name>

14. To remove a untracked file from working directory:
git clean -xdf 

15. To reset a commit to previous commit:
git reset HEAD^ ## the ^ sign denotes the no. of commit back we need
git reset HEAD~2 ##~2 denotes the no. of commit back we need

16. To revert back to a commit pushed in remote repo and push back to remote repo:
git revert <SHA Value of Latest commit>

17. Git Ignore:
## no .log file -- 
*.log

## Track Error.log, even .log are ignored
!Error.log

## only ignore TODO in current dir and not in subdir/TODO
/TODO

## ignore all files in the build /dir
build/

## ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt

18. Branch Concept:
## To create a branch --
git checkout -b <branch_name>

## To merge the changes switch to main branch --
git merge <branch_name>

## To publish a branch --
git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>

19. Conflict-Resolving
Git Commands to Resolve Conflicts
1. git log --merge 

The git log --merge command helps to produce the list of commits that are causing the conflict
2. git diff 

The git diff command helps to identify the differences between the states repositories or files
3. git checkout 

The git checkout command is used to undo the changes made to the file, or for changing branches
4. git reset --mixed 

The git reset --mixed command is used to undo changes to the working directory and staging area
5. git merge --abort

The git merge --abort command helps in exiting the merge process and returning back to the state before the merging began
6. git reset

The git reset command is used at the time of merge conflict to reset the conflicted files to their original state 

20. Git Tags:
Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository’s history as being important. 
use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on).
## To list all tags --> git tag --list / -l 
## To Search for a tag --> git tag -l "tag_name"

Creating Tags
Git supports two types of tags: lightweight and annotated.

A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change -- it’s just a pointer to a specific commit.

Annotated Tags:
Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple. The easiest way is to specify -a when you run the tag command: git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"

Sharing Tags:
git push origin <tagname>

Deleting Tags:
git tag -d <tagname>

Checking out Tags:
git checkout <tag>

21. Git Stash: 
This command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.
Save a mod file in working directory--
git stash save "some description"

View Stashes:
git stash list

Bring the changes back:
git stash pop <stash_no.> (will remove the work from stash as welll)
git stash apply <stash_no.> (will keep work in stash)

Clear the Stash:
git stash drop <stash_no>

22. Git Remotes:
Manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track.

Add--
git remote add <name> url
eg. git remote add origin git@github.com:user/gitbasic.git

View--
git remote -v
git remote show <name>

Remove--
git remote remove <name>
